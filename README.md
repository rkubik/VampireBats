# VampireBats

Plugin that replaces passive bat's with monster vampire bat's
that are aggro and transform into vampire's.

Vampire bat's are able to survive direct sunlight while their
vampire form cannot and will either randomly die or transform
back into a bat.

If a player is holding a poisonous potato named "garlic" then
both vampire bat's and vampire's will not attack the player.

No config required.

**Note:** Only version 1.12 is supported. Pull requests welcome.

## Commands

Spawn a vampire:

    /vamp spawn vampire
