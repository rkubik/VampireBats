# VampireBats

Plugin that replaces passive bat's with monster vampire bat's
that can attack and transform into a vampire.

Vampire bat's are able to survive direct sunlight while their
vampire form cannot and will die immediately.

No config required.

**Note:** Only version 1.12 is supported. Pull requests welcome.

## Commands
